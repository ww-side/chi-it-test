### Search
The search is done by input. In the drop-down list we can select the search 
criterion. We can sort the cars by availability with another drop-down list.

### Add new car
The new object is added to the end of the list. After clicking on the button 
we have a modal window for adding a new car. In order to add a new car you 
need to fill in all the fields.

### Actions(Edit, Delete)
Next to each car there is a drop-down list that allows us to choose the action 
to take. When you choose to delete, we get a modal window with a question. If 
you choose to edit, we get a modal window with fields. Color, price and 
availability are available for editing.
